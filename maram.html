	<h1>Good evening sir/Ma'am 
			My name is Maram Macham by blood an Nigeran and by bith an American I have been around a quite few educational programs trougougt my tinure as a student and I can honestly say that I have been challenged every day's one way or another because of the inteligence of the instructors around me. I studied Mathematics and computer Science there there. It is an honar to be appart of this fisrt batch of students in Code Plateauand I greatly appriciate the knowledge and wisdom that is being passed along from you all. At times I feel as though things may be a little misguided from our topics we always end up gaining something worth while in the process one way or another. I am thourally enjoying the course. I am just waiting for the play things to cease and for the real work begin. As I stated before I studied computerscience in Univerity and have used c++ and f# for practical uses before, and I am greatly interested in learing what you all have in store for us in future. Not that I look forward to people leaving our commmunity or anything but I cant wait to see te true few that will be more deticated, efficient and diverse few who will commit and finish the program at the top.</h1>
