My Experience on Code Plateau.

So far my experience on code plateau has been good.i started about two weeks ago and progress has been made because i'm now a local computer expert.
 the first week was basically introduction to computer science.we finally graudated to more interesting stuff like pseudocode and algorithms which i understood was the background for programming that is Sequence or steps used to solve a specific problem.we finally went into command line which is basically a text interface that takes command and executes it.now we are using VCS which is version control system.VCS tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on a project.now we are working on git.
the experience has been good but there are a few things i would like for them to work on like the place is congested and the internet connection is slow.other than that i like the teaching because they try to carry us along.so far so good..
